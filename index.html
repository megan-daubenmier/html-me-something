					<h1>How It Started</h1>	
					<p>So I actually grew up playing soccer. I barely knew what a frisbee was, let alone how to throw one. My childhood had been spent trying to beat my own juggling record in the backyard, playing club soccer, and with spontaneous games of indoor. However, that all changed three years ago when I moved to STL. I had been spoiled with fun-loving communities full of sportsmanlike friends with whom I could play for hours in college gyms that we didn't have to pay extra for. In STL, I found disgruntled players paying a steep $10/40 minutes of play time. Suddenly, soccer lost some of its appeal.</p>

					<p>Enter my trip to Chicago. My best friend from college had moved home to the Chicagoland area after school. I decided to go visit her one weekend, and she was super excited to bring me to the frisbee group she'd been playing with. Needless to say, I had a blast, and it turned out that one of the women playing had a brother who played frisbee back home. One connection led to another, and before I knew it I was driving out to the field, back home in STL, to play pick up Ultimate with a bunch of strangers.</p>

					<h1>How It's Going</h1>
					<p>That first game of pick-up Ultimate with strangers was nearly two years ago now, and I've never looked back. Luckily some of my field awareness and other game-time concepts transferred over from soccer, so the soccer-to-frisbee transition wasn't too rough. I enhanced my backhand and I learned how to flick, but I'm still working on that hammer. I play just about every weekend, rain or shine, snow or sleet, and twice a week in the warmer months. Needless to say, that first day was just the beginning.</p>

					<h1>Why It's Integral</h1>
					<p>There's lots of reasons why Ultimate frisbee is great. The most generic reasons are the same reasons why any exercise is great: good for physical and mental health, breaks up the work week, etc. But there are so many other reasons why frisbee is great.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>First off, there's the social life. When I first moved to STL after college, I didn't really know anyone at all. Frisbee introduced me to some awesome people, who I am still friends with today. We play frisbee, but we hang out outside of frisbee as well. Frisbee gave me not just a game, but a community.</li>
						<li>Frisbee is a wonderful game for inclusivity. Due to the chill nature of pick-up and the way that marking works, any skill level can play as long as there is an equal number of people at similar skill levels on both teams. This gives frisbee a wonderful opportunity to be a truly co-ed sport where many other sports struggle.</li>
						<li>Finally, frisbee is basically the ultimate nerd sport. Too small to play football? No problem. Too short for basketball? Not an issue. No foot skills for soccer? All you need to do is run, catch, and throw. This makes frisbee the perfect sport for all those who felt un-athletic growing up.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>So in sum, no matter who you are, frisbee can be the sport for you. Theres's tons of pick-up groups in STL - check it out at the following links!</p>
